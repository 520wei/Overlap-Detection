The detection of overlapping speech segments is of key importance

in many speech applications involving analysis of multi-party con-
versations. The problem is challenging because these regions are

typically elicited in far-field microphone recordings as short regions

of the speech signal. In this paper, we propose overlap detection us-
ing a recurrent neural network architecture consisting of long-short

term memory (LSTM) models.Overlap detection
