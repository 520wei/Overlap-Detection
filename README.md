# Overlapped Speech detection in Multi-party Conversations

This is a project on overlapped speech detection in multi-party conversation meetings. We explore the effectivness of various features such as Mel Spectrogram, kurtosis etc using a neural network approach on two datasets: [TIMIT](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/ldc93s1) and AMI. We make use of force alignment to rectify the errors inherent in human annotations of the AMI dataset.
